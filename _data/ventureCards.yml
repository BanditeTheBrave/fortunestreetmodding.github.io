# Venture Cards

# defaultEasy: Whether the card is found in easy mode by default.
# defaultStandard: Whether the card is found in standard mode by default.
# description: The in-game description of the card.
# descriptionExtra (optional): An add-on to the in-game description in case it is not descriptive enough.
# effect: The group name for cards with similar effects. This is an abstraction of the existing groups denoted in the in-game descriptions before the exclamation mark.
# grade: The power of a card within an effect group, ranging between 0 and 4 (D, C, B, A, S). Power is measured by how devastating the effect is with regards to the sentiment and the other cards in the group. In order to avoid bias, a card's power is strictly ordered within its effect group. In cases where there are not enough unique power levels to fill all the grades, prefer the grades closest to B, rounding up if necessary.
# TODO: Reassign effects and grades.
# sentiment: How beneficial the effect is to the player who draws the card (-1 = negative, 0 = neutral, 1 = positive).
