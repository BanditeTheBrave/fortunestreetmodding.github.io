# Venture Cards

# defaultEasy: Whether the card is found in easy mode by default.
# defaultStandard: Whether the card is found in standard mode by default.
# description: The in-game description of the card.
# descriptionExtra (optional): An add-on to the in-game description in case it is not descriptive enough.
# effectGroup: The group name for cards with similar effects, no more than 4 per group (5 if absolutely necessary). This is an abstraction of the existing groups denoted in the in-game descriptions before the exclamation mark.
# effectGroupPower: The power of a card within a group, starting at 0 and going no higher than 3. Power is measured by how devastating the effect is in regards to the sentiment. This should always count up (unless effects are too similar to each-other).
# effectSentiment: How beneficial the effect is to the player who draws the card. (-1 = negative, 0 = neutral, 1 = positive)
# TODO: Add "grade" using the same ranking system as Fortune Street. (C, B, A, S)
